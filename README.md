# New figures

* Since there are no decentralized baseline algorithms, we compare our algorithms with their single-machine counterparts to see if our decentralized algorithms can converge to similar solutions. Specifically, M-SCGDM is the single-machine counterpart of D-M-SCGDM, while M-SCVRGD is the single-machine counterpart of D-M-SCVRGD. To make a fair comparison, we set the sample batch size and hyperparameters of the single-machine algorithm to be same as those of its decentralized counterpart. 

* From these two figures, we can find that our decentralized algorithms can converge to almost the same solution as the single-machine counterparts, which confirms the correctness of our algorithms.
